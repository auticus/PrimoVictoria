Make the models move to the FRONT of their stand touching the destination not the middle
---> when clicking a point, calculate the actual position (the point in the middle of the stand) and move to that instead
---[ ] - the front of the stand should be where the mouse click is
---[ ] - the calculated position does not allow for that for whatever reason

[ ] - when moving - the stands are smacking each other or some can't move (especially near the hill)

[ ] - wheel a whole unit moving (fun times)
