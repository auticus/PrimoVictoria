Make the models move to the FRONT of their stand touching the destination not the middle
---> when clicking a point, calculate the actual position (the point in the middle of the stand) and move to that instead
---[ ] - the front of the stand should be where the mouse click is
---[ ] - the calculated position does not allow for that for whatever reason

pointing and clicking - it doesn't understand to stay in formation.  it doesn't understand wheeling

[ ] - when moving - the stands are smacking each other or some can't move (especially near the hill)

[ ] - wheel a whole unit moving (fun times)
---> wheel based off of a rotation click (right arrow / left arrow) (WheelUnitLeft / WheelUnitRight)
---> wheel based off of turning to face a point (right click)
--->[X] Rotate changes
redoing standmoveposition - just returning a direction to rotate
------> something has to exist to either keep this vector in the direction it needs OR stop it
------> when complete the braces will rotate left and right, and right clicking should rotate the stand
	to where it needs to go

Wheeling - right now rotation goes around the center of the stand.  We need rotation to go from a corner
Unit should be able to calculate its left and right wheel pivot point based on width of the front rank

When wheeling - the initial wheel the center stand jumps out... why?  thats what causes it to be fucked
also - the stands can snag on each other.  might want to turn physics off or whatever would cause them to touch like that

InitializeUnit:  104.8, 0.1, 80.7

Rotating it in place doesn't cause the jump
Its ALWAYS when the unit first moves (even if rotating first (fine) then moving (jumps))

Update 1: 104.8, 0.4, 80.7 step = 0.00402
Update 2: 105.7, 0.3, 81.5 (+0.9, -0.1, +0.8) - step = 0.0194 this is the lurch or jump you see
Update 3: 105.8, 0.3, 81.6 (+0.1, 0, +0.1) - step = 0.0046
Update 8: 105.9, 0.3, 81.6 (+0.1, 0, 0) - step = 0.0054

DeltaTime is a lot on that first frame and then evens out
Record other stands for same 

Both Stands record a move of 0.020 and then it slides to 0.0055

Happens when there are multiple units - each unit has this happen (initial move jumps an entire unit and then smooths out)
This only happens to stand #1 though.  Stand 2-x move fine!  (found via debug logs)

So Time = 0.02 on initial and then falls to 0.002168 after
Delta Time likely not the culprit.  The other stands are receiving the same delta time and dont jitter
And when we hardcode delta time to be 0.002 it still jumps exactly the same
=======================================

KEY SHORTCUTS
[ ] - rotate stands left & right
up arrow, down arrow, left arrow, right arrow - will move a selected unit
wasd - also moves the camera
Camera Tilt up and down (c and v)
Camera rotate (q and e)
Developer Mode - F12
LeftShift - stops rotation

Right Mouse button - rotates and tilts camera when held


Distance between two 3d points = pythagorum theorum
p1 (10,0,5) and p2 (6,2,8)
Distance between them?  
square root of ((6-10)^2 + (2-0)^2 + (8-5)^2)
or square root of ((-4)^2 + (2)^2 + (3)^2)
or square root of ((16) + (4) + (9)) or square root of 29
or 5.385

Computing magnitude (distance) of a vector
Given two positions p1 and p2
var diff = p1 - p2;  (diff is now a vector3)
var magnitude = diff.magnitude;
var direction = diff.Direction;

diff is both the distance between the two points and the direction from p1 to p2.
p1 and p2 are both what are known as POSITION VECTORS
the 0,0,0 position vector is the ZERO VECTOR

FINDING THE DIRECTION
Following the vector ... given two points we can determine the distance or Vector (as above)
therefore the direction is how you travel from p1 to p2
so p2 = p1 + Vector(d) = (x1 + dx, y1 +dy, z1 + dz) or = (x2, y2, z2)
or - given a start point p1, if you apply the vector d to it, you will get to p2

var direction = p2.transform.localPosition - p1.transform.localPosition;

SCALING A VECTOR - multiplying it

VELOCITY - the magnitude of the vector

v1 = (2,2)-(5,4)
v2 = (5,4)-(8,4)
v3 = (7,6)-(13,8)

Vector Dot Product
Given two vectors in 3d space, the dot product between the two vectors is defined as the sum of the product of the corresponding components.  Or:
V1 * V2 = x1x2 + y1y2 + z1z2
The result of this will be a floating-point number
This number represents the cosine of the angle between the two vectors.  this value will always fall between 0 and 180.
